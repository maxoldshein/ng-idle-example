This repository contains a very basic example of how to utilize the ng2-idle Angular 2 library. With this example, I tried to create a visualization of what is going on behind the scenes on the front-end of the application as well.

To utilize this example, clone this repository to your local machine, `cd` to the directory where this project is stored, and run the following command:

`npm install`

This will install the necessary depedencies that are required to run this project. The only dependency should be:

`@ng-idle/core`

After you have installed all of the required dependencies, serve the application using:

`ng serve --open`

This will open a browser with the application running and you will be able to see how the code is utilizing the ng-idle library. I tried to add comments throughout the code to explain what is going on.
